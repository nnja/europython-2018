themes I like:
business class #2

ostrich grey & pink
or white (and adjust highlight color)        


TODO
- check mine and maxes notes from open source bridge
- grab theme from pink laptop, how to share themes between computers?
- fix random fucking captializations
- talk about beyond PEP8
- more python and vs code stuff
- check speaker notes in powerpoint
- watch original talk and take notes

- talk about pre-commit hooks, include code

- mention pulling down the review to your own computer

Notes:
Talk a little bit about why we want to code review
have you thought about why you do it, besides for my boss told me so, or it's a habit on my team?

Look up interesting VS Code feature that can help
- integrated github pull requests in vs code
- live screen sharing
- format on save (i.e. with black)

think about less slides, how to condense them

Add bit about checking in with yourself. Have you eaten, gotten enough to drink? Do you need a walk? Are you stressed?

# [fit] Why Code Review?

---

# [fit] Code Reviews Can <br> Be Frustrating
![](https://i.redd.it/06mc6ezq8uiz.jpg)

---

# Apparent Code Review Frustrations

 - Adds time demand
 - Adds process
 - Can bring up team tensions
 - ‚Äúsmart‚Äù devs think they don‚Äôt need it

---

# How do you get people to change the way they work?

# By showing them crystal clear benefits

---

# Find Bugs & Design Flaws

 - Design flaws & bugs can be identified and remedied before the code is complete
 - Case Studies on Review:
 - ‚¨á bug rate by 80%
 - ‚¨Ü productivity by 15%

 [.footer https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-reviews-just-do-it/]

---

# The goal is to find bugs **before your customers** do.

----

# Shared Ownership

 - We‚Äôre all in this together
 -  üëÄ results in positive motivation
 -  Overall increase in code quality
 -  No developer is the only expert
 -  Developers gain familiarity with modules via Review
 -  Decrease the ‚ÄúI Quit" Factor

---

# I Quit Factor? 
- concentrated specialized knowledge
- will one person sabotage the project if they left?

---

# Leave a Paper Trail
 - Code Reviews add a wealth of knowledge!
 - Why was a particular decision made?

---

# Code Review Benefits?
- Find Bugs
- Shared Ownership
- Shared Knowledge
- Reduce Bus Factor
- Leave a Paper Trail

---

# I've become a much better programmer by participating in code reviews

Process?

- GitHub (lots of other tools exist)
- GitHub reviews (this was so painful before they existed)
- Blocked merging (can't merge without a green check)

---

Grow  a culture

---

# It starts with a commitment

- Make a commitment to always Review before Merge
- Present the Facts
- Don‚Äôt force it
- New ideas take time to root

---

# Code Reviews need to be Universal

- Doesn‚Äôt matter how Senior / Junior you are
- Only Senior Devs reviewing == bottleneck
- Inequality breeds dissatisfaction
	- Break down old barriers and status quos

---

# Code Review is done by your **peers, not management**.

---

# Consistent Code

- Your code isn‚Äôt yours, it belongs to your Company
- Code should fit your company‚Äôs expectations and style, not your own.
- Reviews should encourage consistency for code longevity

---

# Style Guide

- Distinguishes personal taste from functionality
- Should be agreed upon before hand
- Great Codebases are written by a team, look like they were written by an individual.

---

# Consistent Code is **Easier to Maintain** by a Team

---

# No Blame Culture

- Failure is inevitable
- Mistakes become team, not individual responsibility
- Needs management support

---

# Blameless Post Mortem

- Meet shortly after Incident Resolved ‚óâ Understand the root cause
- Document how it was fixed
- Identify how to prevent it in future

---

For a blameless culture, don‚Äôt **point fingers!**

---

# When code reviews are part of the culture, people don‚Äôt expect their changes to be reviewed, **they want** their changes to be reviewed.

---

# Let's Review: How to Grow Culture?

- Make a Commitment
- Universal Code Review
- Performed by Peers
- Style Guide for Consistency
- Starts with No Blame Culture

---

# How should we code review?

--- 

# #1: Be a great reviewer.

---

# Have Emapthy.

# Don‚Äôt be a Perfectionist

 - For big issues, don‚Äôt let perfect get in the way of perfectly acceptable.
 - Prioritize what‚Äôs important to you.
 - Usually 90% there is good enough.

---

# It‚Äôs OK to Nit-Pick

 - Syntax Issues
 - Spelling Errors
 - Poor Variable Names
 - Missing corner-cases
<br>
 Save the nit-picks for last, after any pressing architecture, design, or other large scale issues have been addressed.

Stages of Review

**0:** before submission
**1:** submitted
**2:** (optional) work in progress (30-50%)
**3:** almost done (90-100%)
**4:** review completed

<!-- TODO this slide is confusing -->

---

# [fit] step 0:# [fit] before submission

---

# [Fit] Provide Context (The Why)

- What was the motivation for submitting this code?
- Link to the underlying ticket/issue
- Document why the change was needed ‚óâ For larger PRs, provide a changelog
- Point out any side-effects

---

# [fit] **YOU** are the# [fit] Primary Reviewer

 - Review your code with the same level of detail you would give giving reviews.
 - Anticipate problem areas

--- 

# [fit] The Primary Reviewer

- Make sure your code works, and is thoroughly tested.
- Don‚Äôt rely on others to catch your mistakes.

---

# Before submitting, try a checlist

<!-- TODO image -->

---

# [fit] ‚òëÔ∏é small stuff

- Did you check for reusable code or utility
methods?
- Did I remove debugger statements?
- Are there clear commit messages?

---

# [fit] ‚òëÔ∏é big stuff

 - Is my code secure?
 - Will it scale?
 - Read the Checklist Manifesto

---

# [fit] step 1:# [fit] submitted

---

# You‚Äôre starting a conversation.

- Don‚Äôt get too attached to your code before the review process
- Anticipate comments and feedback
- Acknowledge you will make mistakes

---

# [fit] step 2 
# [fit] *(optional)*# [fit] work in progress

---

# [fit] Submit **Work in Progress** Pull Requests

- Necessary for bigger features
- Don‚Äôt be afraid of showing incomplete, incremental work
- Open them your code is 30-50% done
- This is the right time to get feedback on architectural and design decisions

---

# [fit] When Code is Work in Progress

Types of Feedback to expect:

- Architectural Issues
- Problems with Overall Design
- Design Pattern Suggestions

---

# [fit] step 3:# [fit] almost done

---

# [fit] When Code is Almost Done

- Feedback to expect:
- Nit Picks
- Variable Names
- Documentation & Comments
- Small Optimizations

^ This process prevents wasting time and effort for bigger, more complex pull requests.

---

# [fit] One Review per Issue

 - If you‚Äôre solving multiple problems, break them up into multiple PRs for ease of review.
 - Solved an unrelated problem? make a new PR with a separate diff
 - You can branch off your feature branch to keep the diff small

--- 

# Prevent Reviewer Burnout

- Remember, reviews lose value when they‚Äôre more than 500 lines of code.
- Keep reviews small and relevant.
- If submitting a big review is unavoidable, give the reviewer extra time.
